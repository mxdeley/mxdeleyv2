Structural engineering students dive into the world of steel beam design early in their university journey. Steel, being among the top three structural building materials, plays a pivotal role. Beams, the go-to static system, are often the choice â€“ particularly the simply supported ones.

As time progresses, structural engineers find themselves immersed in the realm of steel beam design repeatedly.

In this post, I am excited to guide you through the process, step-by-step, illustrating steel beam design with a practical example.

Discover the various loads that can impact a beam and unravel the technique of classifying a steel cross-section as per the Steel Eurocode EN 1993-1-1.

Imagine a steel beam elegantly supported, bearing a point load at its midpoint.

1. Unveil the forces acting on the beam
2. Explore load combinations
3. Unravel the steel beam's properties
4. Dive into Cross-Section Classification
5. Verify Bending Strength
6. Confirm Shear Strength
7. Check for Lateral Torsional Buckling
8. Ensure Deflection meets requirements

Let's dive into the world of steel beams and their characteristic loads! When it comes to a structure, the loads it bears are influenced by where it stands, its shape, the type of building, and more.
For the sake of this guide, picture us designing the beam of a single-story building like a supermarket. In such a building, a variety of loads come into play:

- The weight of structural and non-structural elements
- The roof's live load
- The snow load
- The wind load

On the roof, the live, snow, wind, and dead loads (including the roof's self-weight) are imposed as area loads [kN/m2].

Imagine the roof as a trapezoidal sheet that passes these loads on to the secondary beams (in our case, timber beams) supporting the sheets.

By multiplying the area loads by the beam spacing, we calculate line loads. These line loads are then applied to the secondary (timber) beams.

The reaction force of the timber beam at midspan represents the characteristic vertical load exerted on the primary steel beams. Let's keep exploring! ðŸš€
